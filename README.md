# erlang-distributed-chatroom

This repository is a forked project from the original ["Distributed Student Platform" web-app](https://github.com/RiccardoSagramoni/distributed-student-platform) by Fabrizio Lanzillo, Federico Montini and Riccardo Sagramoni (university project for MSc Computer Engineering).

The aim of this project is to improve the chatroom feature of the original application:

- [x] Rewrite the procedural code in Javascript to a **object-oriented** code in **Typescript**
- [ ] Implement a fully distributed approach for Erlang nodes by removing the Mnesia database and adopting a multicast pattern for the communication between nodes. This should improve responsiveness and reliability against faults for updating the list of currently online users.
